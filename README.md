# SqlFamilyMastodon
A list of people from the #sqlfamily.
I read that it's hard to find people so thought that it might be handy to create a list to get the family started.
If you like to be on the list, feel free to add yourself.
I really hope this will add something to our family.


## rules
The rules are fairly easy. If you're a member of the SQL Family and behave as such you can be added to this list.
Either by connecting with me on Mastodon or creating a PR with your addition. If you want, you can send me an email as well on my first name at gmail dot com.

## feedback
If you like the idea but have better ideas for execution, please get in touch with me. I'd love to discuss improvements!
